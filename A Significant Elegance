I marvel at her elegance
elegance born of an understanding
an esthetic awareness, the knowing of who she is 
She embraces both the beauty and limitations of her form
Wearing what pleases her 
no longer putting pretty things away for some future occasion 

Her clothing creates movement
for she does not wish to stay still
I see her eyes sparkle with the eagerness of yesterday's child
the exuberance of her endless possibilities
Still a subtle sadness resides
a warning of sorts
an "approach with caution"
"come to me, but keep your distance"
perhaps she feels safer that way

Maybe this is part of her aesthetic
for music cannot exist without tension
notes are born of apposing forces
So I will ask my questions
attempt to understand 
I will hear what she wishes to tell
and I will try to comprehend
Most importantly I will appreciate her elegance
the freedom she finds within her laughter
Her inquisitiveness as she peers over her glasses
for she is both a teacher and a student
life for her remains and adventure
and she chooses to live it
one note at a time
until she has written her symphony
until she has painted all of her colors
until she realizes that pain serves a purpose
Without it we never truly become
we never truly know
who we really are
